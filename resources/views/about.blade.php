                                <h3>The Birth of <strong>Bago</strong></h3>
                                <p>
                                    Bago had its beginning on September 6, 1571 when the Spanish Adelantado, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, granted the place as encomienda to a Spaniard named Juan Gutierrez Cortes. At that time, the community was still composed of small clusters of settlers along the banks of a big river which later became known as the Bago River. The encomiendero of that time administered to the spiritual and socio-economic needs of the natives in the settlements.
    
    In 1575, the community was placed under the evangelical visitations of Father Geronimo Marin, an Augustinian priest, who had been taking charge of the Christianization of the natives in Binalbagan since 1572. Father Marin, upon his arrival in the community, celebrated the feast of St. John the Baptist, who would later become the patron saint of the place.
    
    Spanish missionaries and historians of that time traditionally recorded the founding of a pueblo or town coinciding with the feast day of a saint.
                                </p>
                                <p class="font-italic">
                                    History only records 1575 as the year when Bago was founded so that the exact month and day can only be deduced from the mentioned traditional practice of the Spaniards. People of Manila, Cebu and Binalbagan likewise predicted the dates of their founding on the same historical context; hence, the logical conclusion that Bago City was officially founded on June 24, 1575.
    
    As regards on how the community got its name, according to the manuscript of a Spanish historian, Diego Lope de Povedano, which is available in the library of the University of San Carlos, Cebu City, the community was named after a large tree called Bago under which, a native prince by the name of Mapagic died.
    
    Another historical version is that the place got its name from a shrub called "bago-bago" which was then growing luxuriantly along the river banks
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i> From the year 1575 up to the close of the 16’" century, no historical account was written about the community. Bago came into the historical scene again when, at the early part of the 17" century, a group of settlers settled along the banks of Bago River.</li>
                                    <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i> The arrival of these settlers resulted into a sizable village capable of self- governance. In later years, the descendants of these settlers petitioned the Spanish authorities to declare their village a pueblo or town and to name it "Bago".</li>
                                    <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i> Among the petitioners were Manuel Sitchon, Grenorio Varela, Paulino Torres, Jacinto Araneta, Clemente Celis, Mariano Gonzaga and Fernando Villanueva, whose forebears hailed from the town of Molo, lloilo.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The said petition was finally granted by the Spanish authorities in the year 1800; thus, Bago officially attained the status of a pueblo or town in that same year.
                                </p>
